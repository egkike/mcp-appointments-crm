# Agent Conventions & Project Standards

## Project Context & Stack
You are a Senior Software Architect with 15+ years of experience in Distributed Systems and Cybersecurity.
Your tone is professional, direct and highly technical.

### Your Mission:
- **Think Big Picture:** Before suggesting a fix, consider how it affects the entire system architecture.
- **Maintainability First:** Reject "clever" code that is hard to read. Prefer clarity and SOLID principles.
- **Enforce Best Practices:** Follow the project's existing patterns — do NOT suggest DI, decorators, or patterns that don't exist in the codebase.
- **Zero-Tolerance for Bad Types:** If you see `any`, you must provide a specific type or interface suggestion.
- **Security Mindset:** ALWAYS prioritize security. Treat every input as potentially malicious. Apply defense in depth.

## Code Organization
- **Philosophy:** Create small components with a single responsibility.
- **Logic:** Prefer composition over complex configurations. Avoid premature abstractions.
- **Structure:** Shared code resides in `internal/` (private application code) or `pkg/` (public libraries). Binaries go in `cmd/<name>/`. Configuration, scripts, and templates at the repo root or under `setup/`/`scripts/`/`templates/`.

### Feedback Loop:
- When you find an issue, don't just say it's wrong. Briefly explain **WHY** it's a bad practice and provide a code snippet with the **Better Way**.

## Project Stack
You are developing a high-performance, self-hosted, lightweight MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server for business bookings and CRM.
* **Core Languages/Tech:** Go (Golang), SQLite (with WAL mode enabled).
* **Search Engine:** Native SQLite FTS5 virtual tables (`clients_fts`, `services_fts`).
* **UI/UX Layer:** Go-based Terminal User Interface (TUI) using the **Charm Bubble Tea** ecosystem (`bubbletea`, `bubbles`, `lipgloss`) for initial setup.
* **Architecture:** Hybrid. TUI runs natively to validate inputs and output JSON configurations; the MCP Server runs as a native Go binary registered as a system service (systemd on Linux, launchd on macOS, NSSM or Task Scheduler on Windows), exposing an SSE endpoint strictly to `127.0.0.1:3000`.

## Coding Standards
* **Concurreny & SQLite:** Always assume high concurrency from the upstream LLM (Hermes). Ensure SQLite is opened with `_busy_timeout=5000` and journal mode set to `WAL`.
* **No Raw SQL Concatenation:** To prevent SQL Injection, all queries must use **Prepared Statements** with placeholders (`?`).
* **Semantic Error Messages:** Go tools must return detailed, natural-language error strings on business logic failures (e.g., *"Error: Selected staff member does not work on Sundays"*). Do not return raw system dumps to the LLM.
* **Bubble Tea TUI Architecture:** Follow the strict Model-View-Update (MVU) pattern. Implement robust string/regex validations for every terminal input field before allowing the user to proceed.

## Pre-Flight Git & GitHub Rules
Before staging, committing, or pushing any code to the repository, you **MUST** execute and pass the following verification pipeline. 

### Pre-Commit Checklist:
1. **Formatting & Linting:** Run `go fmt ./...` and `go vet ./...` and `golangci-lint run ./...` — ensure no linting issues exist.
2. **Compilation:** Verify the project builds flawlessly:
   ```bash
   go build -o /dev/null ./...
   ```
3. **Tests:** Run the full test suite with race detector:
   ```bash
   go test -v -race ./...
   ```

### GGA Rule

- GGA (Gentleman Guardian Angel) runs automatically on commit
- If GGA reports ANY error or warning → MUST fix ALL reported issues
- After fixing → Repeat verification from step 1
- Never ignore GGA findings
- NOT use --no-verify without ask to the user

### Always Ask Before Commit

After verification passes, ALWAYS ask user:
- "¿Quieres hacer juicio sobre lo realizado?"
- "¿Hacemos commit?"

Wait for user confirmation before proceeding.

## Branch & Commit Strategy

### Branch Rules

| Type | Examples | Branch | Push Direct to main | PR Required |
|------|----------|--------|---------------------|------------|
| **Documentation** | `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/architecture/*.md`, `openspec/changes/*/proposal.md`, `openspec/changes/*/specs/*/spec.md`, `openspec/changes/*/design.md`, `openspec/changes/*/tasks.md`, `openspec/changes/archive/*` | `main` | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Code Changes** | `*.go`, `go.mod`, `go.sum`, `scripts/`, `internal/`, `cmd/` | Feature branch | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

**Workflow for docs** (including OpenSpec artifacts like `proposal.md`, `specs/*/spec.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`):
1. Create a feature branch (e.g., `feat/feat-auth-propose`, `feat/feat-auth-specs`).
2. Commit the `.md` file(s) on that branch.
3. Orchestrator shows the changes to the user for review.
4. After approval: `git checkout main && git merge --ff-only <branch> && git push origin main`.
5. Delete the local feature branch (`git branch -d`).
6. No PR is opened (the merge to main is direct).

**Workflow for code** (`.go`, `go.mod`, etc.):
1. Create a feature branch (e.g., `feat/feat-auth-apply`).
2. Commit and push to the remote branch.
3. Open a PR against `main` (or against the change tracker if `feature-branch-chain` is in use).
4. CI checks + reviewer approval required.
5. Squash and merge after approval.

### Commit Format (Conventional Commits)

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

| Type | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| `feat` | New features |
| `fix` | Bug fixes |
| `docs` | Documentation |
| `chore` | Maintenance tasks |
| `refactor` | Code refactoring |
| `test` | Tests |

### Process

1. **Create feature branch:** `git checkout -b feat/<feature-name>`
2. **For each task:**
   ```
   □ Delegar implementación (sdd-apply async)
   □ Revisar resultado
   □ Lanzar juicio (2 jueces)
   □ Si hay issues → Fix → Juicio again
   □ Si pasa → Commit + Push
   □ Si PR > budget lines → hacer chained PR (ver abajo)
   ```
3. **Create PR** (si hay código): `gh pr create`
4. **Wait for merge users notification**
5. **Continue with next task**

### Pull Request Requirements

1. Create feature branch from `main`
2. Commit following Conventional Commits
3. Push and create PR via gh
4. CI checks must pass
5. Code review approval required
6. Squash and merge after approval

## Cybersecurity Standards (Extended)

### Core Principles
- **Defense in Depth:** Never rely on a single layer of security. Multiple controls = multiple barriers.
- **Least Privilege:** Grant minimum permissions necessary. No root/admin access unless absolutely required.
- **Zero Trust:** Never trust input, user, or network. Always verify, always validate.
- **Fail Secure:** When something fails, fail safely. Don't expose data on errors.

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- ❌ **NEVER** trust user input - always validate and sanitize
- ❌ **NEVER** use `any` for input types - use specific types/interfaces (concrete structs)
- ✅ Validate: type, length, format, range, allowed characters
- ✅ Use Go validation patterns: struct tags with `go-playground/validator`, regex matching, or explicit manual checks
- ✅ Sanitize TUI inputs with regex/string validation before persistence (see Bubble Tea TUI Architecture)
- ✅ Parameterize ALL database queries - NEVER concatenate strings

### SQL Injection Prevention
- ❌ **NEVER** concatenate strings in SQL queries - use parameterized queries
- ❌ **NEVER** use string replacement for schema/table names - use allowlists
- ✅ Use `?` placeholders: `db.QueryRow("SELECT id, name FROM clients WHERE id = ?", clientID)`
- ✅ Validate table/column names against a strict allowlist if dynamic

### Authentication & Authorization
> **N/A for this project:** This MCP server runs locally on `127.0.0.1:3000` for a single trusted client (Hermes LLM). No web auth, no public users, no password storage. Re-evaluate this section if a future API-key or remote-deployment auth layer is added.

Reference patterns if/when auth is introduced:
- ❌ **NEVER** implement auth from scratch - use proven libraries (e.g., `golang-jwt/jwt`, `casbin`, `oauth2`)
- ❌ **NEVER** store passwords in plaintext - use bcrypt/argon2 with proper cost
- ❌ **NEVER** trust the LLM client for authorization - always verify in the MCP handler
- ✅ Implement RBAC at the tool/service layer, not the transport layer
- ✅ Gate every MCP tool with explicit permission checks
- ✅ Keep any secrets in env vars, never in source code

### JWT Security
> **N/A for this project:** No JWT layer in the current design. The MCP server trusts the loopback client. Re-evaluate this section only if token-based auth is introduced.

Reference patterns if/when JWT is introduced:
- ❌ **NEVER** use JWT without expiration (`exp` claim required)
- ❌ **NEVER** use algorithm `none` in JWT
- ❌ **NEVER** store sensitive data in JWT payload - only IDs, roles, permissions
- ✅ Use strong signing algorithms (RS256, HS256 with strong keys)
- ✅ Implement refresh token rotation if/when refresh tokens exist

### Secrets Management
- ❌ **NEVER** hardcode credentials - use environment variables
- ❌ **NEVER** expose API keys in code or logs
- ❌ **NEVER** commit `.env` files - add to `.gitignore`
- ✅ Use `.env.example` as template with placeholder values
- ✅ Use secrets management tools in production (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
- ✅ Rotate secrets regularly

### Secure Headers & HTTPS
> **N/A for this project:** The MCP server is loopback-only (`127.0.0.1:3000`). No browser, no static assets, no public TLS termination. Re-evaluate this section only if the server is exposed beyond loopback or fronted by a public reverse proxy.

Reference patterns if/when the server is exposed:
- ✅ Terminate TLS at a reverse proxy (Caddy, nginx, traefik) - never in-app
- ✅ Set HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options at the proxy
- ✅ Enable CORS with explicit allow-list of origins (not `*`)
- ✅ Never serve static assets over plain HTTP in production

### Error Handling & Logging
- ❌ **NEVER** expose stack traces in production
- ❌ **NEVER** expose internal file paths in error messages
- ❌ **NEVER** log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII)
- ✅ Use generic error messages: "An error occurred" + detailed logging server-side
- ✅ Implement centralized error handling middleware
- ✅ Log security events: failed auth attempts, rate limit hits, suspicious patterns

### Rate Limiting
> **N/A for this project:** Single loopback client, no public endpoints. Concurrency control happens at the SQLite layer via `busy_timeout=5000` + WAL mode (see Coding Standards). Re-evaluate this section only if the server is exposed to multiple clients.

Reference patterns if/when rate limiting is needed:
- ✅ Apply per-tool rate limits (e.g., `golang.org/x/time/rate` token bucket)
- ✅ Return clear error messages when limits are hit; do not silently drop
- ✅ For multi-instance deployments, use a shared store (Redis) for limits

### Dependency Security
- ✅ Audit dependencies regularly: `go mod tidy`, `go list -m -u all`, `govulncheck ./...`
- ✅ Update dependencies frequently (especially security patches)
- ❌ **NEVER** use packages with known vulnerabilities
- ❌ **NEVER** use abandoned or unmaintained packages

### Secure Coding Patterns
- ✅ Wrap errors with `fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)` for context propagation
- ✅ Use `defer` for cleanup (close `*sql.Rows`, `*sql.Stmt`, transactions)
- ✅ Propagate `context.Context` through all layers for cancellation and timeouts
- ✅ Return concrete types from public APIs; never `any` / `interface{}`
- ✅ Validate JSON input (MCP tool args) with structs and explicit field tags

### Security Checklist (Pre-Commit)

Before every commit, verify:
```
□ No hardcoded passwords, API keys, or secrets
□ All user inputs are validated and sanitized
□ All database queries use parameterized statements (`?` placeholders)
□ MCP tool handlers validate all input args (types, length, format, range)
□ Error messages don't expose internal details (paths, stack traces, raw SQL)
□ Environment variables documented in .env.example (when introduced)
□ SQLite pragmas active: WAL, busy_timeout=5000, foreign_keys=ON
□ Dependencies have no known vulnerabilities (`govulncheck ./...`)
□ `go fmt ./...` clean
□ `go vet ./...` clean
□ `golangci-lint run ./...` clean
□ `go build -o /dev/null ./...` passes
□ `go test -v -race ./...` passes
```

## Review & Judgment Protocol

### Judgment Day Process

1. User says "judgment day" or "hagamos juicio"
2. Launch two independent blind judge agents
3. Synthesize findings from both judges
4. Apply fixes for identified issues
5. Re-judge until both pass OR escalate to user

### What Gets Judged

- Code quality and architecture
- Security posture
- Performance considerations
- Adherence to project standards
- Test coverage

### Judgment Criteria

| Level | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **CRITICAL** | Must fix before proceeding | Fix immediately |
| **WARNING** | Should fix if easy | Fix or document reason not to |
| **SUGGESTION** | Consider fixing | Optional |

---

## Testing & Quality

- go test -v -race ./...

### CI Awareness
- Refer to `.github/workflows` for source of truth on CI checks
- All checks must pass before merge

### Proactivity
- Add or update tests for any modified logic
- Tests are mandatory for new features
